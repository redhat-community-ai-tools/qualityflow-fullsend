# PR Fix Agent

**Phase:** Post-Review Automation
**Purpose:** Close the external review loop by fixing PR review comments on
STP/STD documents automatically.

## Context

This agent handles the **external** fix loop — review comments posted by humans
or bots (e.g., CodeRabbit) on a PR containing QualityFlow-generated documents.
This is distinct from the **internal** refine loop (`/refine-stp`, `/refine-std`)
which uses QualityFlow's own reviewer.

The agent is invoked by the `/fix-pr` command or by CI (GitHub Actions /
GitLab CI) on `pull_request_review.submitted` events.

## Required Skills

Must invoke these skills during execution:

1. **project-resolver** — Resolve project context from the Jira ID in the PR
2. **comment-classifier** — Classify review comments into auto-fix vs needs-human
3. **scenario-builder** — Rewrite or add scenarios (Rule A, missing scenarios)
4. **tier-classifier** — Reclassify tier assignments
5. **template-engine** — Fix structural/template issues (Rules B, D, E, F, G, H, J)
6. **output-validator** — Validate structural integrity after edits
7. **stp-reviewer** — Re-review STP after fixes (optional validation pass)
8. **std-reviewer** — Re-review STD after fixes (optional validation pass)
9. **pii-sanitizer** — Ensure no PII introduced during fixes

## Input

```yaml
pr_url: "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123"
# OR for GitLab:
# pr_url: "https://gitlab.example.com/group/project/-/merge_requests/456"
review_id: null  # optional: specific review to process (latest if null)
dry_run: false   # if true, classify and report but don't edit or push
```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Resolve Context

1. **Extract PR metadata** using `gh` CLI or GitLab MCP:

   ```bash
   gh pr view {pr_number} --json number,headRefName,baseRefName,title,body,files
   ```

2. **Detect document type** from changed files. Match both QualityFlow output
   conventions and external repo conventions:
   - STP: `*_test_plan.md` OR `*-stp.md`
   - STD: `*_test_description.yaml` OR `*-std.md` OR `*-std.yaml`
   - Both → process each type separately
   - Neither → exit with "No QualityFlow documents found in this PR"

   Store matched file paths for later staging.

3. **Extract issue identifier** using a multi-source fallback chain:
   a. Filename: `{PREFIX}-{NUMBER}` (e.g., `PROJ-12345_test_plan.md`)
   b. PR body: scan for Jira URLs, Jira IDs, or GitHub issue URLs
   c. PR title: same patterns
   d. PR labels: Jira-ID-shaped labels
   e. Branch name: extract from branch
   If no identifier found, warn but continue (project context optional).

4. **Read target repo review rules:** Check for `AGENTS.md` in the target repo.
   If found, pass its content to the comment-classifier as `target_repo_rules`.

5. **Resolve project** via project-resolver skill with the extracted issue ID.
   If resolution fails (unknown prefix), log warning but continue — the
   comment-classifier can work with `target_repo_rules` alone.

6. **Check for local repo** before cloning. If project context was resolved,
   read `repositories.yaml` from `config_dir` and check if any repo entry
   matches `{owner}/{repo}`. If a match with `local_path_env` exists, check
   whether the env var points to a valid local clone (`$LOCAL_PATH/.git`
   exists). Use the local repo if available; fall back to `gh pr checkout`.

### Step 1: Fetch Review Comments

Fetch all review comments on the PR:

```bash
# Get reviews (top-level review verdicts)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews

# Get inline review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
```

**Filter to actionable comments:**

- If `review_id` is provided: only comments from that review
- If `review_id` is null: comments from the latest `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review,
  plus any unresolved inline comments from any reviewer
- Skip resolved comments (if the platform supports resolution status)
- Skip bot comments from QualityFlow itself (marker: `<!-- qualityflow:pr-fix-agent -->`)

**Enrich comments with section context:**

For each inline comment that has a `path` and `line`:
1. Read the target file
2. Determine which STP/STD section the line falls in
3. Attach `section` metadata to the comment

### Step 2: Classify Comments

Invoke the **comment-classifier** skill with the collected comments:

```yaml
comments: <filtered comment list from Step 1>
document_type: "stp" | "std"
project_context: <from Step 0, or null if resolution failed>
target_repo_rules: <content of AGENTS.md from target repo, or null>
target_repo: "{owner}/{repo}"
```

The classifier returns:
- `auto_fix`: comments that can be fixed automatically, with fix routing
- `propose_fix`: comments where the agent researched available sources and
  proposes text for human approval (not applied automatically)
- `needs_human`: comments that require human input

**If all comments are needs-human (no auto-fix AND no propose-fix):**
- Post a summary comment on the PR (see Step 5 format)
- Exit without making any edits

**If dry_run is true:**
- Output the classification results (including proposed fixes with sources)
- Exit without making any edits

### Step 3: Apply Fixes

Process auto-fixable comments in priority order:

1. **CRITICAL severity first**, then MAJOR, then MINOR
2. Within same severity, process by fix type:
   - `structural` fixes first (template-engine) — these affect document shape
   - `rule-violation` fixes second (scenario-builder) — content rewrites
   - `missing-scenario` fixes third (scenario-builder) — new content
   - `tier-mismatch` fixes fourth (tier-classifier) — classification changes
   - `metadata-error` fixes last (template-engine) — minor corrections

**For each auto-fix comment:**

#### 3a. Rule Violation Fixes (scenario-builder)

When `fix_action` is `rewrite-scenario`:
1. Read the target line and surrounding context from the document
2. Identify the scenario text that violates the rule
3. Rewrite the scenario following the rule's requirements:
   - **Rule A:** Replace internal-mechanism language with user-observable language
   - **Rule A.2:** Remove vague qualifiers, anthropomorphizing, hedging
   - **Rule C:** Move prerequisite to Test Environment (II.3), replace with
     behavioral verification scenario
   - **Rule K:** Remove regression-only scenario from Section III, note it in
     Test Strategy (II.2) regression checkbox
4. Apply the edit using the Edit tool

#### 3b. Missing Scenario Fixes (scenario-builder)

When `fix_action` is `add-scenario`:
1. Identify the requirement the comment references
2. Generate scenarios following scenario-builder rules:
   - Start with action verb (Verify, Test, Validate, Confirm)
   - 5-10 words
   - Include positive and/or negative as needed
3. Insert the new scenario under the correct requirement in Section III
4. Assign tier and priority using tier-classifier conventions

#### 3c. Structural Fixes (template-engine)

When `fix_action` is `restructure`:
1. Read the STP template from `{project_context.config_dir}/templates/stp/`
2. Compare current structure against template
3. Fix section ordering, heading levels, missing sections
4. Move content to correct sections if misplaced

#### 3d. Tier Fixes (tier-classifier)

When `fix_action` is `reclassify`:
1. Read the comment to determine the correct tier
2. Update the tier assignment in Section III
3. If changing from Tier 1 to Tier 2 (or vice versa), update the framework
   reference accordingly

#### 3e. Metadata Fixes (template-engine)

When `fix_action` is `update-metadata`:
1. Identify the metadata field referenced in the comment
2. Fetch correct value from Jira (if accessible) or from the comment itself
3. Update the field in the document

### Step 4: Validate

After all fixes are applied:

1. **Structural validation** — invoke output-validator skill:

   ```yaml
   skill: output-validator
   args: "{JIRA_ID}"
   ```

   If validation fails:
   - Identify which fix broke the structure
   - Revert that specific fix using `git checkout -- <file>` for the affected lines
   - Log the revert
   - Re-validate

2. **Self-review** (optional, controlled by `self_review` flag):
   - For STP: invoke stp-reviewer skill on the fixed document
   - For STD: invoke std-reviewer skill on the fixed document
   - If new CRITICAL findings are introduced by the fixes, revert and flag

3. **PII check** — invoke pii-sanitizer skill to ensure fixes didn't introduce PII

### Step 5: Report and Push

#### 5a. Post Fix Summary Comment

Post a comment on the PR with the fix summary. Use an HTML marker for
in-place updates on subsequent runs:

```markdown
<!-- qualityflow:pr-fix-agent -->
## QualityFlow Fix Agent Report

**Document:** {document_type} for {JIRA_ID}
**Comments processed:** {total_comments}

### Auto-Fixed ({auto_fix_count})

| # | Comment | Rule/Category | Fix Applied |
|:--|:--------|:--------------|:------------|
| 1 | {summary} | Rule A | Rewrote scenario to user-observable language |
| 2 | {summary} | Missing scenario | Added negative scenario for {requirement} |

### Proposed Fixes — Awaiting Approval ({propose_fix_count})

| # | Comment | Proposed Change | Source | Confidence |
|:--|:--------|:----------------|:-------|:-----------|
| 1 | {summary} | {proposed_text} | VEP #14056 | medium |

> Reply with the numbers you approve (e.g., "approve 1, 3") to apply on next run.

### Needs Human Input ({needs_human_count})

| # | Comment | Reason |
|:--|:--------|:-------|
| 1 | {summary} | Scope decision — requires lead sign-off |

### Validation

- Structural: PASS
- Self-review: {verdict or "skipped"}
- PII check: PASS
```

If a previous fix-agent comment exists (same marker), collapse the old content
into a `<details>` block and update in-place.

#### 5b. Commit and Push

```bash
git add -u
git add outputs/ stps/ 2>/dev/null || true
git commit -m "fix(stp): address review comments for {JIRA_ID}

Auto-fixed {N} review comment(s):
- {fix summary 1}
- {fix summary 2}

{M} comment(s) flagged for human input.

Co-Authored-By: QualityFlow <noreply@qualityflow>"

git push origin HEAD
```

#### 5b.5. Update PR Title and Description

After a successful push, update the PR title and description to match the
target repo's conventions. Do NOT append QualityFlow status tables or diffs
to the description — reviewers can see changes in commits.

**Title:** If any review comment requested a title change, apply it:

```bash
gh pr edit {pr_number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --title "{new_title}"
```

**Description:** Populate the PR body using the target repo's PR template.

1. Fetch the target repo's PR template:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md \
     --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d
   ```

   If no template exists, skip description updates.

2. Read the current PR body. If it has unfilled template sections (HTML
   comments still present, placeholder text), fill them in using context
   from the fix run:

   - **STP Metadata / VEP issue:** From the STP's Enhancement(s) field
     or the linked Jira/GitHub issue
   - **What this PR does:** Summarize using the document's Feature Overview
     (1-3 sentences)
   - **Special notes for your reviewer:** Relevant review context (which
     sections were auto-fixed, scope boundaries)

   Preserve any content the PR author already filled in.

3. Update the PR:

   ```bash
   gh pr edit {pr_number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --body "$updated_body"
   ```

**If `gh pr edit` fails:** Log a warning but do not fail the overall run.

#### 5c. Handle Push Failure

If `git push` fails (e.g., branch protection, conflicts):
1. Log the error
2. Post a comment: "Fix agent completed edits locally but could not push.
   Error: {error_message}. Please pull the changes manually or resolve the conflict."
3. Do not retry — let the human resolve

## Configuration

### Iteration Cap

Maximum **10** fix cycles per PR. Track iterations via a counter in the
fix-agent PR comment. If iteration count >= 10:

1. Post comment: "Fix agent reached maximum iterations (10). Remaining
   comments require manual attention."
2. Exit without further edits

### Self-Review Toggle

The self-review step (Step 4.2) is controlled by the project's feature toggles:
- `stp_review: true` → run stp-reviewer after STP fixes
- `std_review: true` → run std-reviewer after STD fixes

If the toggle is false, skip self-review.

### Concurrency

If the fix agent detects it is already running on the same PR (via the marker
comment containing "Fix in progress..."):
- Exit immediately with "Fix agent already running on this PR"
- This prevents parallel fix runs from conflicting

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|:---------|:---------|:--------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` | Yes (GitHub) | PR read/write access |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` | Yes (GitLab) | MR read/write access |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | No | Jira access for metadata fixes |
| `JIRA_USER_EMAIL` | No | Jira authentication |

## Error Handling

- **PR not found:** Exit with error message
- **No QualityFlow documents in PR:** Exit with "No STP/STD files found"
- **No review comments:** Exit with "No actionable review comments found"
- **Project resolution fails:** Exit with error (unknown Jira prefix)
- **Comment classifier returns all ambiguous:** Classify all as needs-human, report
- **Edit tool fails:** Log the specific edit failure, skip that fix, continue
- **Validation fails after all reverts:** Push whatever is valid, flag in report
- **Git push fails:** Report error, do not retry

## GitLab Support

For GitLab merge requests, replace `gh` CLI calls with GitLab MCP tools or
`glab` CLI equivalents:

| GitHub (`gh`) | GitLab (`glab` / API) |
|:-------------|:----------------------|
| `gh pr view` | `glab mr view` or MCP `get_merge_request` |
| `gh api .../reviews` | GitLab MR discussions API |
| `gh api .../comments` | GitLab MR notes API |
| `gh pr comment` | `glab mr comment` or MCP |

The comment-classifier skill is platform-agnostic — it operates on normalized
comment data regardless of source.
