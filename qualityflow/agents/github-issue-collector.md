# GitHub Issue Collector Subagent

**Phase:** Pre-Processing
**Purpose:** Collect comprehensive GitHub issue data, producing output identical in structure to jira-collector

## Tools Available

- mcp__github__issue_read
- mcp__github__pull_request_read
- mcp__github__search_issues
- mcp__mcp-atlassian__jira_get_issue
- Read

## Required Skills

Must invoke this skill during execution:
1. **link-resolver** - Build dependency graph from discovered links

## Project Context

This agent receives `project_context` from the orchestrator, which includes:
- `config_dir`: Path to the project configuration directory
- `github_issue`: Object with `owner`, `repo`, `number`, `url`
- `jira_id`: Canonical filesystem-safe ID (e.g., `my-org-my-repo-1234`)
- `stp_header`: The expected STP document header
- `versioning`: Version derivation information

## Workflow

### Step 0: Load Config

Extract `owner`, `repo`, `number` from `project_context.github_issue`.

Optionally read `{project_context.config_dir}/github.yaml` for label mappings. If the file does not exist, use default mappings:
- `bug` → `{ issue_type: "Bug" }`
- `enhancement` / `feature` → `{ issue_type: "Enhancement" }`
- `critical` / `P0` → `{ priority: "Critical" }`

Also read `{project_context.config_dir}/components.yaml` for component-to-package mappings.

Read `jira_legacy_urls` from `config/_defaults.yaml` to recognize Jira URLs in text fields.

### Step 1: Fetch Main GitHub Issue

Use `mcp__github__issue_read` with:
- `owner`: The repository owner
- `repo`: The repository name
- `issue_number`: The issue number

Extract and map fields:
- `title` → `summary`
- `body` → `description`
- `state` (open/closed) → `status`
- `labels[].name` → `labels` (array of label name strings)
- `milestone.title` → `fix_version` (or null if no milestone)
- `user` (author) → `reporter` `{name: <login>, email: null}`
- `assignee` → `assignee` `{name: <login>, email: null}` (or null)
- `created_at` → `created` (ISO 8601)
- `updated_at` → `updated` (ISO 8601)

### Step 2: Fetch All Comments

Use `mcp__github__issue_read` with:
- `owner`, `repo`, `issue_number`: Same as Step 1
- `method`: `get_comments`

For each comment, extract:
- `id`: Comment ID
- `author`: `{name: <user.login>, email: null}`
- `created`: `created_at` in ISO 8601
- `body`: Comment body text

### Step 3: Scan Body and Comments for Linked URLs

Scan the issue body AND all comment bodies for cross-references. This is critical
for discovering PRs, related issues, and Jira tickets.

#### 3.1 GitHub PR URLs

Pattern: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}`
Also match enterprise GitHub: `https://{github_host}/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}`
where `{github_host}` is any hostname (supports `github.company.com` etc.)

For each match, add to `pr_urls`:
```yaml
- url: <matched URL>
  source_issue: <project_context.jira_id>
  source_type: description | comment
  is_main_issue: true
```

#### 3.2 GitHub Issue URLs

Pattern: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`
Also match enterprise GitHub: `https://{github_host}/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`

Exclude the main issue itself. For each match, add to `github_issue_urls`:
```yaml
- url: <matched URL>
  source_issue: <project_context.jira_id>
  source_type: description | comment
  is_main_issue: true
```

#### 3.3 Jira Issue URLs

Pattern: `https://your-org.atlassian.net/browse/{KEY}` or legacy URLs from `jira_legacy_urls`

For each match, add to `jira_issue_urls`:
```yaml
- url: <matched URL, normalized to canonical form>
  source_issue: <project_context.jira_id>
  source_type: description | comment
  is_main_issue: true
```

#### 3.4 GitHub Short References

Patterns:
- Same-repo: `#123` (resolves to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/123`)
- Cross-repo: `other-owner/other-repo#456`

Add to `github_issue_urls` by default. The github-pr-fetcher downstream will
disambiguate PRs from issues when fetching.

#### 3.5 Track Per-Comment URL Extraction

For each comment, record `pr_urls_found` and `issue_urls_found` arrays alongside
the comment data. This matches the jira-collector output structure.

### Step 4: Parse Acceptance Criteria from Body

Search the issue body for structured acceptance criteria sections:

1. Markdown heading: `## Acceptance Criteria`, `### AC:`, `## Expected Behavior`
2. Checkbox lists: `- [ ] criteria item` or `- [x] criteria item`
3. Numbered lists following an AC heading

Extract the content below the heading until the next heading or end of body.
If no structured AC section found, set `acceptance_criteria: null`.

### Step 5: Discover Linked PRs and Dependencies

GitHub issues use implicit linking, not structured relationships like Jira.
Collect from multiple sources:

#### 5.1 PR Cross-References

Already collected in Step 3.1. These are PRs mentioned in the issue.

#### 5.2 Closing PRs

Search for PRs that close this issue. If `mcp__github__search_issues` is available:
```
query: "repo:{owner}/{repo} is:pr linked:{number}"
```

Also scan issue body and comments for patterns like:
- `closes #N`, `fixes #N`, `resolves #N`
- These indicate PRs that address this issue

#### 5.3 Dependency Language

Parse issue body for dependency keywords:
- "blocked by #X" or "blocked by owner/repo#X" → `blocked_by` relationship
- "depends on #X" → `depends_on` relationship
- "related to #X" → `relates_to` relationship
- "blocks #X" → `blocking` relationship

#### 5.4 Cross-Repo References

`owner/repo#N` patterns in body and comments indicate cross-repo links.
Resolve to full URLs.

### Step 6: Fetch Linked GitHub Issues (1 Level Depth)

For EACH GitHub issue URL discovered in Step 3.2 and 3.4 (excluding the main issue):

1. Parse the URL to extract `owner`, `repo`, `issue_number`
2. Call `mcp__github__issue_read` with `method: get`
3. Extract: `title`, `body`, `state`, `labels`, `assignee`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
4. Call `mcp__github__issue_read` with `method: get_comments`
5. Scan comments for additional PR URLs and issue URLs
6. Generate the linked issue's canonical key: `{owner}-{repo}-{number}`

Record each linked issue with full metadata:
```yaml
- key: <owner-repo-number>
  summary: <title>
  description: <body>
  status: <state>
  issue_type: <derived from labels>
  relationship: <from Step 5.3, or "relates_to" default>
  link_type: <inferred relationship description>
  link_category: <relates|blocking|dependency>
  assignee: {name: <login>, email: null}
  reporter: {name: <user.login>, email: null}
  components: []
  labels: [<label names>]
  fix_version: <milestone or null>
  created: <ISO 8601>
  updated: <ISO 8601>
  acceptance_criteria: null
  pr_urls:
    - url: <PR URL found in this linked issue>
      source_type: description | comment
  issue_urls:
    - url: <issue URL found in this linked issue>
      source_type: description | comment
```

**Important:** Do NOT recursively follow links from linked issues. Only process
direct references from the main issue.

### Step 7: Fetch Linked Jira Issues (If Any)

For EACH Jira issue URL discovered in Step 3.3:

1. Extract the Jira key from the URL path (`/browse/{KEY}`)
2. Call `mcp__mcp-atlassian__jira_get_issue` with:
   - `issue_key`: The extracted Jira key
   - `comment_limit`: 100
3. Extract: key, summary, description, status, issue_type, priority, components,
   labels, acceptance_criteria, fix_version
4. Extract PR URLs from "Git Pull Request" custom field and comments
5. Extract GitHub issue URLs from description and comments

Record as a linked issue with `relationship: "cross_reference"`:
```yaml
- key: <Jira key, e.g., PROJ-12345>
  summary: <summary>
  description: <description>
  status: <status>
  issue_type: <issue type>
  relationship: cross_reference
  link_type: "referenced in GitHub issue"
  link_category: relates
  assignee: {name: <name>, email: <email>}
  reporter: {name: <name>, email: <email>}
  components: [<component names>]
  labels: [<labels>]
  fix_version: <version or null>
  created: <ISO 8601>
  updated: <ISO 8601>
  acceptance_criteria: <criteria or null>
  pr_urls: [<PR URLs from Jira issue>]
  issue_urls: [<issue URLs from Jira issue>]
```

This enables hybrid workflows where GitHub issues reference Jira tickets.

### Step 8: Derive Issue Metadata from Labels

Use label mappings from `github.yaml` (if available) or defaults:

**Issue type derivation:**
- Labels containing `bug` → `issue_type: "Bug"`
- Labels containing `enhancement`, `feature`, or `feature-request` → `issue_type: "Enhancement"`
- Otherwise → `issue_type: "Issue"`

**Priority derivation:**
- Labels containing `critical`, `P0`, `priority/critical` → `priority: "Critical"`
- Labels containing `P1`, `priority/high`, `high-priority` → `priority: "Major"`
- Labels containing `P2`, `priority/medium` → `priority: "Normal"`
- Otherwise → `priority: "Major"` (default)

**Component derivation:**
- Labels matching `sig/*` patterns → map to component names using `components.yaml`
- Example: `sig/network` label → component `sig-network` → package `pkg/network/`

### Step 9: Extract Feature Candidates for LSP Validation

**This step runs ALWAYS to support LSP validation even when no PRs exist.**

From the parsed issue data, extract potential test features:

#### 9.1 From Title and Body

Extract:
- Technical terms and feature names (capitalized terms, quoted identifiers)
- API types mentioned (VirtualMachine, VMI, DataVolume, VolumeSpec, etc.)
- Function names and file paths in backtick blocks
- Component names that map to packages

#### 9.2 Component-to-Package Mapping

Read `{project_context.config_dir}/components.yaml` for the component-to-package mapping.

Map GitHub labels (especially `sig/*` labels) to package paths using this mapping.

#### 9.3 From Acceptance Criteria

Each acceptance criteria item suggests a testable area. Extract as feature candidates.

#### 9.4 From Linked Issues

Extract:
- Related feature names from linked issue titles
- Dependencies mentioned
- Integration points from cross-repo references

#### 9.5 Output Feature Candidates

Build a structured list:
```yaml
feature_candidates:
  explicit_mentions:
    - <features/functions/components named in title>
    - <API types mentioned: VirtualMachine, VMI, etc.>
  component_hints:
    - component: <component name>
      package_path: <mapped package path>
  acceptance_criteria:
    - <each AC item as potential test feature>
  integration_points:
    - <dependencies/integrations from linked issues>
```

### Step 10: Aggregate and Deduplicate URLs

Compile all GitHub PR URLs from:
- Main issue body
- Main issue comments
- Linked GitHub issues (body and comments)
- Linked Jira issues ("Git Pull Request" custom fields and comments)

Deduplicate the PR URL list. Preserve source tracking for each URL.

Compile all GitHub Issue URLs from:
- Main issue body
- Main issue comments
- Linked issues (body and comments)

Deduplicate the issue URL list.

Compile all Jira Issue URLs from:
- Main issue body
- Main issue comments

Deduplicate the Jira issue URL list.

### Step 11: Invoke link-resolver Skill

Invoke the **link-resolver** skill to build the dependency graph.

Pass the discovered links with inferred relationship types from Step 5.3.
For links without explicit dependency language, use `relates_to` as default.

The skill will:
- Categorize link types
- Build hierarchical relationship structure
- Identify key dependencies

### Step 12: Build Final Output

Assemble the output in the same YAML structure as jira-collector.

## Output Format

Return YAML:
```yaml

## GitHub URL Patterns

### GitHub PR URL Pattern

Scan for URLs matching:
- `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}`

### GitHub Issue URL Pattern

Scan for URLs matching:
- `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}`

**Disambiguation:** URLs containing `/pull/` are PR URLs. URLs containing `/issues/`
are issue URLs. The path segment is the discriminator.

### Jira URL Patterns

Scan for URLs matching:
- Canonical: `https://your-org.atlassian.net/browse/{KEY}`
- Legacy: URLs from `config/_defaults.yaml` `jira_legacy_urls`

Normalize all Jira URLs to canonical form in output.

### GitHub Short Reference Patterns

Scan for:
- Same-repo: `#123` (no preceding alphanumeric character)
- Cross-repo: `owner/repo#456`

Resolve to full GitHub URLs using the current repository context.
