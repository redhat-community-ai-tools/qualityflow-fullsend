# STP Generator Subagent

**Phase:** Core Processing
**Purpose:** Generate the STP document from collected data

## Project Context

This agent receives `project_context` from the orchestrator, which includes:

- `config_dir`: Path to the project configuration directory
- `stp_header`: The expected STP document header (from project config)
- `versioning`: Version derivation information (product name, version pattern)

Read `{project_context.config_dir}/project.yaml` for STP header text, product versioning info, and other project-level metadata used in document generation.

## No Line Limits

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT enforce minimum row counts for Section III. The number of test scenarios should be determined by the feature's complexity and regression analysis, not by arbitrary minimums. Generate comprehensive coverage without artificial limits.

## Tools Available

- Read
- Write
- Edit

## Required Skills

Must invoke these skills during execution:

1. **requirement-mapper** - Map requirements to testable scenarios
2. **scenario-builder** - Build test scenario descriptions
3. **tier-classifier** OR **test-strategy-resolver** - Classify tests (see Step 4)
   - `test_strategy: "tier"` → tier-classifier
   - `test_strategy: "auto"` → test-strategy-resolver
4. **template-engine** - Apply STP template structure

## Domain Judgment Rules

These rules govern content quality decisions throughout the STP. Apply them during
all generation steps.

### Rule A — Abstraction Level for Scope and Goals

Scope items and testing goals describe **what the user can do and observe**, not how
the system achieves it internally.

#### Pre-Writing Decomposition

Before writing scope, goals, or test scenarios, decompose the feature into three layers:

| Layer | Definition | Example (network change) | Example (CPU hotplug) | Example (VM snapshot) |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|
| **User Action** | What the user/admin does (API call, spec change, CLI command) | Patches VM spec to change networkName | Adds CPUs to a running VM via API | Creates a point-in-time backup of a VM |
| **Observable Outcome** | What the user/admin sees happen as a result | VM ends up on the new network without restart | VM reports additional CPUs without restart | Snapshot is available for restore |
| **Internal Mechanism** | How the system achieves it under the hood | Live migration, controller reconciliation, spec sync | QEMU hotplug protocol, topology reconciliation | CSI volume snapshot, freeze/thaw agent |

**Scope and Goals use ONLY User Action and Observable Outcome.**
Internal Mechanism goes to Technology Challenges (I.3), Risk descriptions (II.5),
and Comments columns only.

#### Litmus Test

Apply the **"Release Notes" test** to every sentence in scope, goals, and test scenarios:

> "Would this sentence appear in customer-facing release notes?"

- YES → keep it (user action or observable outcome)
- NO → move it to Technology Challenges, Risks, or Comments (internal mechanism)

Examples:

- "You can now change the network configuration on a running resource without restarting it." → YES, keep
- "The reconciler compares status annotations to detect changes." → NO, move
- "Resources can be scaled up without downtime." → YES, keep
- "The internal protocol negotiates topology changes with the agent." → NO, move

#### Where Each Layer Appears

| Layer | Scope (II.1) | Goals (II.1) | Test Scenarios (III) | Tech Challenges (I.3) | Risks (II.5) | Comments |
|:------|:-------------|:-------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------|:-------------|:---------|
| User Action | YES | YES | YES | — | — | — |
| Observable Outcome | YES | YES | YES | — | — | YES |
| Internal Mechanism | NO | NO | NO | YES | YES | YES |

#### Section III Application

The litmus test applies **per-item** in Section III. Both the **Requirement Summary** and
**Test Scenario** must use User Action / Observable Outcome language only.

**Requirement Summary** MUST use user-story format ("As a [role], I want to [action]"):

| BAD (Internal Mechanism) | GOOD (User Story) |
|:-------------------------|:-------------------|
| RestartRequired condition is not set for config-only changes | As an admin, I want to modify the network config without triggering a restart |
| Controller reconciles resource topology | As an admin, I want to scale resources on a running instance |
| Snapshot driver creates volume snapshot | As an admin, I want to create a point-in-time backup of my resource |
| Reconciler detects network change | As an admin, I want the network change applied without manual intervention |

**Test Scenario** MUST be short, user-perspective phrases. Describe what the user
observes, not the technical operation performed:

| BAD (too verbose / technical) | GOOD (user perspective) |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Verify network config change takes effect and resource connects to new network | Verify resource is reachable on new network |
| Verify scale-up completes and resource reports updated capacity | Verify resource has additional capacity after scale-up |
| Verify snapshot creation succeeds and restore produces a running resource | Verify resource data is intact after snapshot restore |
| Verify live migration completes and workload continues without interruption | Verify workload survives migration |

#### Red-Flag Patterns

If a Requirement Summary or Test Scenario contains any of these patterns,
rewrite it in user-facing language:

- **"X condition is set/not set"** — conditions are internal API objects; describe
  what the user observes instead (restart required? stays running?)
- **"controller/reconciler/evaluator does X"** — internal components; describe the
  outcome the user sees
- **"annotation/label contains X"** — internal metadata; describe the behavior it
  represents
- **"sync/reconcile completes"** — internal process; describe the user-visible result
- **"trigger/triggered by"** — implementation sequence; describe what happens, not
  what triggers it

These are not a hard blocklist — context matters. "RestartRequired" in a test *step*
(where you check it programmatically) is fine. But in a *Requirement Summary* or
*Test Scenario* column, rewrite to customer language.

#### Undefined Terminology Check

Before writing scope, goals, or scenarios, scan the generated text for
domain-specific compound terms that may be unclear without definition:

- Compound adjectives used as qualifiers (e.g., "X-compliant", "Y-compatible",
  "Z-aware", "X-enabled") where the qualifier references a specific technology,
  standard, or component
- Acronyms or abbreviations not widely known in the QE domain

When such a term is found:

1. Check if the term is defined in Document Conventions
2. Check if the term is explained in its first usage context
3. If neither: add a parenthetical definition at first usage OR add it to
   Document Conventions

| Undefined term | Resolution |
|:---------------|:-----------|
| "HCO-compliant" | Add "(conforming to the HyperConverged Operator's default configuration)" at first usage |
| "DPDK-enabled" | Add "(with Data Plane Development Kit acceleration)" at first usage |
| "CSI-provisioned" | Add "(provisioned through Container Storage Interface)" at first usage |
| "FLR-capable" | Add definition in Document Conventions |

This prevents reviewers from asking "What does X mean?" for terms that
are project jargon rather than universal QE vocabulary.

### Rule B — Section I is a Meta-Checklist

Section I items are checkbox entries that confirm the QE review **PROCESS** was followed.
Each item uses the **standard guidance text from the upstream template** — these are fixed
strings prescribed by the template, not feature-specific content.

Feature-specific observations (e.g., "VEP #140 defines clear scope boundaries",
"upstream e2e tests exist") go in the **Comments sub-item only**.

Do NOT fill checkbox item descriptions with:

- Lists of acceptance criteria
- Technical requirement descriptions
- Feature-specific value propositions
- Detailed testability assessments

### Rule C — Prerequisites vs Test Scenarios

A configuration required for the feature to work is a **prerequisite**, not a test scenario.

| Prerequisite (NOT a test scenario) | Test Scenario (YES) |
|:------------------------------------|:---------------------|
| UpdateStrategy=LiveMigrate must be set | Verify config change takes effect on running resource |
| Feature gate must be enabled | Verify feature gate controls feature availability |
| Cluster needs 2+ schedulable nodes | Verify resource connects to new network after change |
| Network definitions must be deployed | Verify error when network config does not exist |

Prerequisites belong in:

- Test Environment (Section II.3)
- Entry Criteria (Section II.4)
- Special Configurations

They do NOT belong in:

- Section III Requirements-to-Tests Mapping
- Testing Goals

### Rule D — Dependencies = Team Delivery, Not Infrastructure

"Dependencies" in the test strategy means **another team must deliver something**
for this feature to be testable or functional.

| NOT a Dependency (Infrastructure) | Actual Dependency (Team Delivery) |
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| CNI plugin is required | Platform team must add the feature gate to config CR |
| Bridge networking must be present | Networking team must update controller for compatibility |
| Shared storage for data transfer | Storage team must deliver new storage class |
| 2+ worker nodes needed | Another team must merge a prerequisite PR |

Pre-existing platform infrastructure is a prerequisite (documented in
Test Environment), not a team delivery dependency.

### Rule E — Upgrade Testing Applicability

Upgrade testing applies when the feature introduces **persistent state that must
survive version upgrades**. It does NOT apply when:

- The feature is a one-time operation (e.g., patching a VM spec field)
- The feature is gated behind a new feature gate with no state migration
- The feature does not modify stored objects in a way that requires conversion

Ask: "If a cluster upgrades from version N to N+1, does existing data/state
created by this feature need to be preserved or converted?" If NO, mark Upgrade
Testing as N/A.

### Rule F — Version Derivation

Derive product versions from the Jira ticket's `fix_version` field and
`project_context.versioning` (which defines the product name and version pattern).
Use the versioning config to determine the correct product and platform version
labels for the test environment -- not hardcoded values.

Never default to older versions. If fix_version is unavailable, use the Current
Status field or leave as TBD.

### Rule G — Testing Tools Section

Section II.3.1 (Testing Tools & Frameworks) only lists tools that are **NEW** or
**DIFFERENT** from standard testing infrastructure.

Standard tools come from project config (`{project_context.config_dir}/tier1.yaml`
and `{project_context.config_dir}/tier2.yaml`), which define the baseline testing
frameworks and tooling for each tier. These standard tools should NOT be listed in
this section.

Only list tools if the feature requires something non-standard (e.g., a custom
performance profiler, a specialized network testing tool, a new test harness).
Leave cells empty if using only standard tools.

### Rule H — Risk Deduplication

Do not add risk entries that duplicate information already covered in Test Environment
(Section II.3). If a risk is just "the test environment needs X", that belongs in
Test Environment, not Risks.

| Duplicate Risk (REMOVE) | Already Covered In |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------|
| "Live migration requires sufficient cluster resources" | Compute Resources row in Test Environment |
| "Requires multi-node cluster" | Cluster Topology row in Test Environment |
| "Needs specific network infrastructure" | Network row in Test Environment |

Risks should describe **uncertainties** and **things that could go wrong**, not
known environment requirements.

### Rule I — QE Kickoff Timing

QE kickoff happens during feature **design**, before implementation begins — not
after PR merge. The Developer Handoff/QE Kickoff row should reflect this:
a meeting where Dev/Arch walks QE through the design, architecture, and
implementation details early enough to identify untestable aspects.

If the PR is still open, the Comments should note that kickoff should be scheduled
(or has been scheduled), not "should be scheduled once PR is merged."

### Rule J — One Tier Per Row in Section III

Each row in Section III gets **exactly one** tier classification. If a requirement
has both Tier 1 and Tier 2 test scenarios, they go in **separate rows**.

| BAD | GOOD |
|:-----|:------|
| Tier 1 (Functional), Tier 2 (E2E) | Row 1: Tier 1, Row 2: Tier 2 |

### Rule L — Coverage-Aware Deduplication

Do not generate test scenarios for behaviors already covered by existing tests in the
source repository. When regression-analyzer reports `existing_test_coverage`, compare
each requirement's evidence symbol against the coverage data:

| Coverage Status | Action |
|:----------------|:-------|
| `EXISTING_COVERAGE` | Do NOT generate test scenario. Show in Section III as informational: `*Existing Coverage:* TestFuncName in file.go — behavior description` |
| `PARTIAL_COVERAGE` | Generate scenario(s) ONLY for the uncovered gap. Reference existing tests for covered behaviors |
| `NEW` | Generate scenarios normally |

**Matching logic:** For each validated requirement from requirement-mapper, check if its
`evidence` symbol appears in `existing_test_coverage[].symbol`. If it does, compare the
requirement's behavioral description against the `behavior_tested` summaries of existing
tests. This is an LLM judgment call — semantic matching, not string matching.

Example:

- Requirement: "Verify all paths reported present when all exist in repo"
- Existing test: `TestComparePathPresence_AllPresent` — "All paths present returns empty missing list"
- Verdict: `EXISTING_COVERAGE` (same behavior described differently)

When `existing_test_coverage` is absent or empty, treat all requirements as `NEW`
(backward compatible — identical to current behavior).

### Rule K — Cross-Section Consistency

After generating all sections, validate that no section contradicts another.

Common contradiction patterns to check:

| Section A | Section B | What to check |
|:----------|:----------|:-------------|
| Section I Comments | Known Limitations (I.2) | Comments must not claim capabilities that limitations explicitly exclude |
| Scope (II.1) | Out of Scope (II.1) | Same item must not appear in both |
| Testing Goals (II.1) | Known Limitations (I.2) | Goals must not promise outcomes the feature does not deliver |
| Section I item N Comments | Section I item N+1 Comments | Adjacent items must not make conflicting claims about the same behavior |
| Test Strategy (II.2) checked items | Section III scenarios | Every checked strategy item has at least one corresponding scenario |
| NFR sub-items (I.1) | Section III scenarios | Every claimed NFR has at least one testing scenario |
| NFR sub-items (I.1) | Test Strategy (II.2) | NFR claims about specific constraints are reflected in strategy details |

When a contradiction is found, align all sections to the most conservative
(most accurate) statement. Known Limitations is the source of truth for
what the feature actually does and does not do.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Receive Aggregated Data

Input from orchestrator:

```yaml
jira_data:
  main_issue: {...}
  linked_issues:
    - key: PROJ-11111
      summary: <summary>
      description: <full description>
      status: <status>
      issue_type: <type>
      relationship: outward
      link_type: blocks
      link_category: blocking
      assignee: {name, email}
      reporter: {name, email}
      components: [...]
      labels: [...]
      fix_version: <version or null>
      created: <ISO date>
      updated: <ISO date>
      acceptance_criteria: <criteria or null>
      pr_urls:
        - url: https://github.com/.../pull/123
          source_type: custom_field
        - ...
    - ...
  subtasks: [...]
github_data:
  pr_details:
    - url: <url>
      source_issue: <jira key>
      source_type: custom_field | comment
      is_main_issue: true | false
      title: <title>
      description: <description>
      files_changed: [...]
      key_changes: [...]
      review_insights: [...]
    - ...
  file_changes: [...]
regression_data:
  impacted_features: [...]
  recommended_tests: [...]
  existing_test_coverage: [...]
  coverage_summary: {...}
```

### Step 2: Invoke requirement-mapper Skill

Invoke the **requirement-mapper** skill and apply it.

The skill will:

- Extract requirements from Jira data
- Apply Requirement Level Validation Gate
- Filter out platform-level tests using `scope_boundaries` from project config
- Map to testable scenarios from regression analysis

Pass:

```yaml
jira_data: <main_issue + linked_issues>
regression_data: <impacted_features + recommended_tests>
```

Expects:

```yaml
validated_requirements:
  - requirement_id: PROJ-12345
    requirement_summary: <specific testable statement>
    source: regression_analysis
    validation_passed: true
  - ...
rejected_requirements:
  - requirement_summary: <rejected requirement>
    reason: Platform-level test (Kubernetes scheduler)
  - ...
```

### Step 2.5: Coverage-Aware Deduplication

**Guard:** Skip this step if `regression_data.existing_test_coverage` is absent or empty.

Apply **Rule L** to tag each validated requirement with a `coverage_status`:

1. Build a lookup map: `symbol → [existing test behaviors]` from
   `regression_data.existing_test_coverage`

2. For each validated requirement from Step 2:
   - Extract the evidence symbol (from `source` or `evidence` field)
   - Check if the symbol appears in the lookup map
   - If YES: compare the requirement's behavioral description against each
     `behavior_tested` summary using semantic matching
     - All behaviors covered → `EXISTING_COVERAGE`
     - Some behaviors covered, some not → `PARTIAL_COVERAGE` (identify the gap)
     - No behavioral overlap → `NEW`
   - If NO (symbol not in lookup): `NEW`

3. Pass `coverage_status` and any `covered_by` metadata to the next step.

**Output per requirement:**

```yaml
- requirement_id: PROJ-12345
  requirement_summary: "Verify all paths reported present"
  coverage_status: EXISTING_COVERAGE
  covered_by:
    - test_function: TestComparePathPresence_AllPresent
      test_file: internal/scaffold/pathpresence_test.go
      behavior_tested: "All paths present returns empty missing list"
```

Requirements tagged `EXISTING_COVERAGE` are NOT passed to scenario-builder. They
appear in Section III as informational entries only.

### Step 3: Build Test Scenarios

For each validated requirement with `coverage_status: NEW` or `PARTIAL_COVERAGE`,
invoke **scenario-builder** skill. Skip `EXISTING_COVERAGE` requirements.

Invoke the **scenario-builder** skill and apply it.

The skill will:

- Generate concise test scenario descriptions
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Keep descriptions brief (one phrase each)

### Step 4: Classify Test Types

**Conditional routing based on `project_context.feature_toggles.test_strategy`:**

#### If `test_strategy == "tier"` (configured projects with tier classification)

Invoke **tier-classifier** skill for each test scenario (existing behavior, unchanged).

The skill will determine:

- **Unit Tests**: Isolated components with mocks
- **Tier 1 (Functional)**: Single feature in real cluster
- **Tier 2 (End-to-End)**: Complete user workflows, multi-feature

#### If `test_strategy == "auto"` (auto-detected projects, FullSend, etc.)

Invoke **test-strategy-resolver** skill once (not per-scenario). Pass
`project_context` and `changed_files` from `github_data`.

The skill returns a `test_strategy` block with detected framework, package,
imports, and descriptive test type labels.

Then classify each scenario using descriptive labels instead of tier numbers:

- `unit` — isolated functions with mocks
- `functional` — single feature with real dependencies
- `integration` — API contracts, component interaction
- `e2e` — complete user workflows, multi-step

Use the same decision logic as tier-classifier's Decision Matrix, but output
the descriptive label. Attach the resolved `test_strategy` block to scenario
metadata for downstream consumption by std-generator and code generators.

**Fix-Scope Enrichment for Bug Tickets:**

If `github_data.pr_details` is available AND the Jira issue type is Bug, Customer Case,
or Defect, extract fix scope information and pass it to tier-classifier as `fix_scope`:

1. Extract from `github_data`:
   - `files_changed`: count of files in the PR diff
   - `functions_changed`: list of modified function/method names from `key_changes`
   - `packages_changed`: list of unique packages/directories containing changes
   - `requires_cluster_interaction`: `true` if changes touch runtime/cluster-facing code
     (e.g., API handlers, controllers, webhooks, app-handler); `false` if changes are
     in validation, utility, or pure logic packages
2. Pass as `fix_scope` in the scenario input to tier-classifier:

   ```yaml
   fix_scope:
     files_changed: <count>
     functions_changed: [<list>]
     packages_changed: [<list>]
     requires_cluster_interaction: <true|false>
     issue_type: <bug|customer_case|defect>
   ```

If no PR data is available or the issue type is Feature/Enhancement, omit `fix_scope` —
tier-classifier uses its standard classification flow.

### Step 5: Apply Template Structure

Invoke **template-engine** skill.

Invoke the **template-engine** skill and use its bundled STP template (`templates/stp-template.md`).

The skill will:

- Structure all sections according to official template
- Ensure correct formats (checkbox lists, bullet lists, and tables as defined by template)
- Apply proper markdown formatting

### Step 5.5: Cross-Section Consistency Enforcement

After generating all sections but before final assembly, perform these
mandatory cross-reference checks. These are **generative** (fix-on-the-spot)
checks, not post-generation review flags.

#### 5.5a: NFR-Scenario Cross-Reference

Read the NFR claims from Section I.1 (Non-Functional Requirements checkbox
sub-items) and the Test Strategy checked items from Section II.2.

For each NFR category claimed or strategy item checked:

| Claimed NFR/Strategy Item | Required in Section III |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------|
| Security Testing [checked] | At least 1 security-focused scenario (injection, RBAC, auth, input validation) |
| Performance Testing [checked] | At least 1 performance-measurable scenario |
| Scale Testing [checked] | At least 1 scale-boundary scenario |
| Monitoring [checked] | At least 1 monitoring/alerting/observability scenario |
| Upgrade Testing [checked] | At least 1 upgrade-path scenario |
| Compatibility Testing [checked] | At least 1 cross-version or cross-platform scenario |

If a checked strategy item has NO corresponding scenario in Section III:

1. Invoke **scenario-builder** to generate a scenario for the gap
2. Add the scenario to Section III with appropriate tier and priority
3. Tag the scenario with `nfr_source` in metadata

This is a generative step — fix the gap immediately, do not leave it as a review finding.

#### 5.5b: Strategy-Scenario Bidirectional Check

For each scenario in Section III, verify its testing type aligns with at
least one checked strategy item in Section II.2:

- Security-focused scenarios require Security Testing to be checked
- Performance scenarios require Performance Testing to be checked
- Upgrade scenarios require Upgrade Testing to be checked

If a scenario exists but its corresponding strategy item is NOT checked:

1. Check the strategy item
2. Add appropriate sub-item text explaining why it applies

#### 5.5c: Testing Type Completeness

Verify the following testing types have presence when their conditions are met:

| Testing Type | Present When | How to Verify |
|:-------------|:-------------|:--------------|
| Self-Validation Testing | Feature has health-check, readiness, or self-diagnostic capability | Scan Jira description for health, readiness, self-test, diagnostics, operator-lifecycle keywords |
| Negative/Error Testing | Any feature with user inputs or state transitions | At least 2 negative scenarios exist in Section III |
| Boundary Testing | Any feature with numeric limits, quotas, or resource constraints | At least 1 boundary/edge-case scenario exists |

If a commonly expected testing type is absent and its condition is met:

1. For **Self-Validation**: Add a sub-item under the most relevant strategy
   checkbox noting self-validation applicability
2. For **Negative/Error**: Generate additional negative scenarios via
   scenario-builder
3. For **Boundary**: Generate a boundary scenario via scenario-builder

#### 5.5d: Scalability Constraint Acknowledgment

When the feature depends on a platform mechanism with known parallelism or
scale limits (e.g., volume hotplug, live migration slots, network interface
limits), verify these constraints are acknowledged in:

1. Section II.2 Scalability/Scale Testing sub-items (if not, add them)
2. At least one Section III scenario that tests behavior at the constraint
   boundary (if not, generate one)

Scan the Jira description and linked issues for constraint indicators:
"limit", "maximum", "concurrent", "parallel", "quota", "capacity".

### Step 6: Generate Document Sections

Generate each STP section, applying Domain Judgment Rules A-K throughout:

#### Metadata & Tracking

- Bullet list format (not table)
- Use `project_context.stp_header` for the document header
- Extract Enhancement(s) from linked issues
- Feature Tracking: The parent-level feature request or initiative. If the main issue has a parent issue, the parent is the Feature. Source: parent issue link or `Feature Link` custom field.
- Epic Tracking: The work-level epic where QE tasks are created and tracked. This is typically the main issue itself. Format: `[KEY](url)`.
- QE Owner(s) - TBD
- Owning SIG from labels/components
- Participating SIGs from cross-references

#### Document Conventions

- Define acronyms or terms specific to this document, or "N/A"

#### Feature Overview

- 2-4 sentence description: what it does, why it matters, key technical components

#### Section I: Motivation and Requirements Review

- Section I.1: Requirement & User Story Review Checklist (checkbox list, not table)
  - "Understand Value" and "Customer Use Cases" are merged into one checkbox item
  - Each item: checkbox + fixed template text (Rule B)
  - Comments: Feature-specific observations only (as sub-items)
- Section I.2: Known Limitations (moved from old II.6)
  - Document known feature limitations, gaps, and constraints
- Section I.3: Technology and Design Review (checkbox format)
  - Each item: checkbox + fixed template text (Rule B)
  - Comments: Feature-specific observations only (as sub-items)
  - Developer Handoff: Apply Rule I (kickoff during design)

#### Section II: Software Test Plan

- Scope of Testing: User-facing behavior only (Rule A)
- Testing Goals: Prioritized P0/P1/P2 list, user-facing (Rule A)
- Out of Scope: Checkbox format (`[ ] Item — PM/Lead Agreement Name/Date`)
- Test Strategy: Grouped checkbox list with categories:
  - **Functional:** Functional Testing, Automation Testing, Regression Testing
  - **Non-Functional:** Performance, Scale, Security, Usability, Monitoring
  - **Integration & Compatibility:** Compatibility (includes backward compatibility), Upgrade, Dependencies, Cross Integrations
  - **Infrastructure:** Cloud Testing
  - Apply Rule D for Dependencies
  - Apply Rule E for Upgrade Testing
- Test Environment: Bullet list format
  - Apply Rule F for version derivation
- Testing Tools: Only NEW/SPECIAL tools (Rule G)
- Entry Criteria: Checkbox format with standard + feature-specific items
  - Prerequisites go here, not in Section III (Rule C)
- Risks: Checkbox format with sub-items
  - Apply Rule H for deduplication

#### Section III: Test Scenarios & Traceability

Requirements-to-Tests Mapping in bullet-based format:

- Format: `- **[Jira-123]** — As a user, I want to...` with indented sub-items:
  - `*Test Scenario:*` brief phrase, user-facing language per Rule A
  - `*Priority:*` P0/P1/P2
- Requirement ID: Jira issue key (not invented IDs)
- Requirement Summary (specific, unique per item, user-story format)
- Test Scenario (brief phrase, user-facing language per Rule A)
- Tier: Exactly one per item (Rule J)
- Priority (P0/P1/P2)
- Filter out prerequisites-as-scenarios (Rule C)

**Critical:** ALL test scenarios MUST come from regression analysis.

#### Section IV: Sign-off and Approval

- Reviewers (TBD)
- Approvers (TBD)

## Output Format

Return YAML:

```yaml
generated_document: |
  # {project_context.stp_header}

  ## **[Feature Title] - Quality Engineering Plan**

  ### **Metadata & Tracking**
  ...

  new: <count>                # requirements with full scenario generation

test_strategy_used: "tier" | "auto"
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Test scenarios ONLY from regression analysis** - Never from Jira comments or PR descriptions
2. **Requirement Level Validation Gate** - Reject platform-level tests
3. **No low-level code/YAML** - Keep at conceptual level
4. **Specific requirement summaries** - Each row unique, not generic
5. **Valid test types only** - Tier 1 or Tier 2 in tier mode; unit/functional/integration/e2e in auto mode (one per row)
6. **Brief test scenarios** - One phrase each, no procedures
7. **Complete coverage** - All impacted features from regression analysis (minus EXISTING_COVERAGE)
8. **Domain Judgment Rules A-L** - Apply throughout generation
9. **Jira issue keys for Requirement IDs** - Never invent IDs
10. **User-facing language** - No internal mechanisms in scope/goals/scenarios
11. **Coverage deduplication** - Do not generate scenarios for behaviors already tested (Rule L)
