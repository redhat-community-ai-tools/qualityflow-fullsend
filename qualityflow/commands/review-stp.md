# Review STP for $ARGUMENTS

You are the STP Reviewer entry point. Perform a comprehensive QE review of the generated
STP document by invoking the **stp-reviewer** skill.

## Input

The user has provided: `$ARGUMENTS`

This should be a Jira ticket ID (e.g., `PROJ-123`, `PROJ-789`) for which an STP
has already been generated.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Resolve Project

Use the Skill tool to invoke the project-resolver skill:

**Tool:** Skill
**Parameters:**
- skill: "project-resolver"
- args: "$ARGUMENTS"

This returns `project_context` containing:
- `project_id`, `display_name`, `jira_id`
- `config_dir` (path to project config files)
- `feature_toggles` (what capabilities are enabled)
- `stp_header`, `versioning`

**If project resolution fails:** Display the error and exit. Do not proceed.

**Check stp_review toggle:**
If `project_context.feature_toggles.stp_review` is false:
- Output: "STP review is disabled for project {project_context.display_name} (stp_review toggle is false)."
- Exit. Do not proceed.

### Step 1: Parse the Jira ID

Extract the Jira ID from `project_context.jira_id` (e.g., PROJ-456).

### Step 2: Verify STP File Exists

Check that the STP file exists:
```
outputs/{JIRA_ID}/stp/{JIRA_ID}_test_plan.md
```

**If STP file does NOT exist:**
- Inform the user: "STP file not found. Please run `/stp-builder {JIRA_ID}` first."
- Exit — do not proceed with review.

**If STP file exists:**
- Read the full STP file content.
- Proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Fetch Jira Source Data

Fetch the Jira ticket data for comparison against the STP. This is essential for
Dimension 2 (Requirement Coverage) and Dimension 4 (Risk & Limitation Accuracy).

Use the Jira MCP tools to fetch:

1. **Main issue:** Use `jira_get_issue` with the Jira ID
   - Extract: summary, description, acceptance_criteria, status, fix_version, labels, components
2. **Linked issues:** From the main issue's links, fetch each linked issue
   - Extract: key, summary, relationship type, description

**If Jira fetch fails:**
- Log a warning: "Could not fetch Jira data. Review will be limited to content-only analysis."
- Set `jira_data_available: false`
- Continue with Steps 4-5 (content-only review)

**If Jira fetch succeeds:**
- Set `jira_data_available: true`
- Store the fetched data for passing to the reviewer skill

### Step 3.1: Extract PR Data for Fix-Scope Analysis

If the Jira issue type (from Step 3) is Bug, Customer Case, or Defect:

1. Extract PR URLs from Jira custom fields, development info, or comments
2. Filter for GitHub PRs (skip GitLab MRs, personal forks, or external repos)
3. For each GitHub PR URL found:
   - Fetch PR details via GitHub MCP tools
   - If fetch fails (deleted, inaccessible, 404), log warning and skip that PR
   - If diff is >5,000 lines, set `fix_scope.files_changed: "large"` and skip
     per-function analysis
   - Extract: `key_changes` (modified functions/methods), `files_changed` (count)
4. If multiple PRs found, aggregate:
   - Sum `files_changed` across PRs
   - Merge `key_changes` lists from all PRs
5. Construct `fix_scope` summary:
   ```yaml
   fix_scope:
     files_changed: <count or "large">
     key_changes: <aggregated list from PR(s)>
     issue_type: <bug|customer_case|defect>
     pr_count: <number of PRs analyzed>
   ```
6. Pass `fix_scope` to stp-reviewer skill context for Rule P evaluation

If no PR URLs are found, all fetches fail, or the issue type is Feature/Enhancement:
- Set `fix_scope: null` — Rule P will be skipped by the reviewer

### Step 3.5: Resolve Review Rules

Invoke the **review-rules-extractor** skill to produce project-specific review rules:

**Tool:** Skill
**Parameters:**

- skill: "review-rules-extractor"
- args: "{JIRA_ID}"

The skill reads project config files (`project.yaml`, `components.yaml`, `tier1.yaml`,
`tier2.yaml`, `patterns/tier1_patterns.yaml`) and optionally scans repositories to extract
review rules dynamically. If a static `review_rules.yaml` exists in the project's config
directory, its values take priority as overrides.

The output is a complete `review_rules` data structure identical to the format the
stp-reviewer skill expects. The `_extraction_metadata` section indicates where each
piece of data came from (config files, repo scans, static override, or defaults).

**If extraction fails entirely:** Log a warning and continue without project-specific
rules. The stp-reviewer skill's general rules still apply.

### Step 4: Read the STP Template

Check for the STP template in priority order:

1. **Fetched template (preferred):** Check if `project_context.repo_rules.stp_template`
   is available (populated by project-resolver Step 9 repo_files fetch). If present, use
   this as the authoritative template — it reflects the team's current official version.
   Set `template_source: "fetched from repo"`.

2. **Local template (fallback):** If `repo_rules.stp_template` is not available, read
   from `{project_context.config_dir}/templates/stp/stp-template.md`.
   Set `template_source: "local config"`.

Pass `template_source` to the skill for confidence reporting.

**If neither source is available:**
- Log a warning: "STP template not found (neither fetched nor local). Rule B check will be skipped."
- Set `template_available: false`
- Continue

### Step 5: Invoke stp-reviewer Skill

Use the Skill tool to invoke the stp-reviewer skill:

**Tool:** Skill
**Parameters:**
- skill: "stp-reviewer"
- args: "{JIRA_ID}"

The skill receives context from the conversation including:
- The STP file content (read in Step 2)
- The Jira source data (fetched in Step 3, if available)
- The project review rules (read in Step 3.5, if available)
- The STP template (read in Step 4, if available)
- The project_context (from Step 0)

Perform the review across all 7 dimensions:
1. **Rule Compliance (A-P)** — Check each rule against STP content
2. **Requirement Coverage** — Compare STP scenarios against Jira acceptance criteria (if Jira data available)
3. **Scenario Quality** — Evaluate specificity, user perspective, distribution
4. **Risk & Limitation Accuracy** — Compare against Jira data (if available)
5. **Scope Boundary Assessment** — Compare scope against Jira feature description
6. **Test Strategy Appropriateness** — Validate Y/N/N/A classifications
7. **Metadata Accuracy** — Compare metadata against Jira data

### Step 6: Generate Review Report

Generate the structured review report per the stp-reviewer skill's output format.

Determine the verdict:
- **APPROVED:** 0 critical findings, 0 major findings
- **APPROVED_WITH_FINDINGS:** 0 critical findings, 1+ major or minor findings
- **NEEDS_REVISION:** 1+ critical findings

Determine confidence level:
- **HIGH:** Jira data available, all sections present, template comparison done
- **MEDIUM:** Jira data incomplete or template unavailable
- **LOW:** Jira data unavailable (content-only review)

### Step 7: Save Review Report

Create the output directory and save the review report:

```
outputs/{JIRA_ID}/reviews/{JIRA_ID}_stp_review.md
```

Use the Write tool to save the report.

### Step 8: Report to User

Once complete, show the user:

```
STP Review Complete: {JIRA_ID}

Verdict: {APPROVED | APPROVED_WITH_FINDINGS | NEEDS_REVISION}
Confidence: {HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW}

Findings: {X} critical, {Y} major, {Z} minor

Reviewed: outputs/{JIRA_ID}/stp/{JIRA_ID}_test_plan.md
Report:   outputs/{JIRA_ID}/reviews/{JIRA_ID}_stp_review.md

{If NEEDS_REVISION:}
Critical findings require attention before proceeding to STD generation.
Review the report for details and recommendations.

{If APPROVED_WITH_FINDINGS:}
STP is usable but has findings worth addressing.
Review the report for improvement recommendations.

{If APPROVED:}
STP passes all review checks. Ready for STD generation.
Next step: /std-builder {JIRA_ID}
```

## Error Handling

**If STP file not found:**
- Error message: "STP file not found at outputs/{JIRA_ID}/stp/{JIRA_ID}_test_plan.md"
- Suggestion: "Please run `/stp-builder {JIRA_ID}` first to create the STP"
- Exit without proceeding

**If Jira data fetch fails:**
- Warning: "Jira data unavailable. Performing content-only review (reduced coverage)."
- Skip Dimensions 2 and 4 (require source comparison)
- Continue with remaining dimensions

**If template not found:**
- Warning: "STP template not found at {path}. Skipping Rule B check."
- Skip Rule B in Dimension 1
- Continue with remaining checks

**If review skill fails:**
- Display error message
- Suggest reviewing the STP manually
- Do not save a partial report

## Prerequisites

**Before running this command:**
1. STP file must exist (run `/stp-builder {JIRA_ID}` first)
2. Jira access is recommended but not required (review works without it at reduced confidence)
